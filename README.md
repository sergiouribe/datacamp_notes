# Data Science Learning Notes in R

This repository contains a collection of Quarto (`.qmd`) files, serving as personal notes and practical examples for various data science topics, primarily using the R programming language.

## Topics Covered

The notes and examples in this repository cover a range of data science topics, including:

*   **Data Import and Export:** Working with various file formats and databases (e.g., CSV, JSON, SQL).
*   **Data Cleaning:** Techniques for handling missing values, inconsistent data, and string manipulation.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Using tools like `dplyr` for transforming and reshaping data.
*   **Data Visualization:** Likely using `ggplot2` for creating various plots (inferred from `07_ggplot2.qmd`).
*   **Statistical Analysis:** Concepts and methods in statistics (inferred from `06_stats.qmd`).
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Techniques for understanding datasets (inferred from `08_EDA.qmd`).
*   **Sampling Methods:** (inferred from `09_sampling.qmd`).
*   **Modeling:** Introduction to data modeling (inferred from `10_modelling.qmd` and `99_multiple_regression_titanic.qmd`).
*   **Specific Case Studies/Examples:** Such as baby name analysis (`04_1_babynames_dplyr_latvia.qmd`) and dental health data (`caries_europe_map_12yo.qmd`).

*(Note: Some topics are inferred from filenames and may be expanded upon further.)*

## Repository Structure

*   **`.qmd` files:** These are Quarto R Markdown files containing the notes, R code, and explanations for each topic.
*   **`datasets/`:** This directory holds datasets used in the examples and exercises.
*   **`images/`:** Contains images, screenshots, and plots embedded within the Quarto documents.
*   **HTML files (e.g., `06_stats.html`, `99_multiple_regression_titanic.html`):** These are pre-rendered versions of some of the Quarto files, viewable directly in a web browser.
*   **`*_files/` directories (e.g., `06_stats_files/`):** These directories contain supporting files for the HTML outputs (like images, CSS, JavaScript).
*   **`datacamp_notes.Rproj`:** An RStudio project file, useful for managing the working directory and environment if using RStudio.

## Technologies and Key R Packages

*   **R:** The primary programming language used.
*   **Quarto / R Markdown:** For creating dynamic documents with embedded code and narrative text.
*   **RStudio:** (Implied) The RStudio IDE is recommended for working with `.Rproj` files and R development in general.
*   **`tidyverse` suite:** A collection of R packages for data science, including `dplyr` for data manipulation and `ggplot2` for plotting (inferred usage).
*   **`DBI`:** For database connectivity.
*   **`RMySQL`:** For connecting to MySQL databases.
*   **`jsonlite`:** For working with JSON data.
*   **`stringdist`:** For string distance calculations and fuzzy matching.
*   **`fuzzyjoin`:** For joining tables based on inexact matches.
*   **`reclin2`:** For record linkage.
*   **`janitor`:** For data cleaning tasks.
*   **`visdat`:** For visualizing missing data.

*(This list is based on packages explicitly loaded or mentioned in the examined files and may not be exhaustive.)*

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_directory>
    ```
2.  **Open in RStudio:** Open the `datacamp_notes.Rproj` file in RStudio for an integrated experience.
3.  **Install Packages:** Before running the `.qmd` files, ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using `install.packages("package_name")`. Key packages are listed above. Many files use `pacman::p_load()` which will attempt to install packages if they are not already present.
4.  **Explore the Quarto Files:** Open the `.qmd` files to view the notes and R code. You can run code chunks interactively.
5.  **Render Quarto Files:** To generate or update the HTML (or other formats) from the `.qmd` files, you can use the "Render" button in RStudio or the `quarto::quarto_render("filename.qmd")` command in the R console.
6.  **View HTML Files:** Pre-rendered HTML files can be opened directly in a web browser for quick viewing.
7.  **Use for Learning:** Refer to the notes and code examples for learning and practicing data science concepts in R.
