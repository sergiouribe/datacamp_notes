```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, 
               tidymodels, 
               performance, 
               kaggler)
```

-   **Multiple Regression**: how to use both numerical and categorical variables in your regression models.

-   **Log Transformation**: log transformations to both house price and size to stabilize variance and make relationships more linear.

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: the relationship between log10_price and house condition, noting trends and variations.

-   **Parallel Slopes Model**: fit a model where different groups (house conditions) have the same slope but different intercepts.

```{r}
# Fit model
model_price_4 <- lm(log10_price ~ log10_size + waterfront, data = house_prices)

# Get regression table
get_regression_table(model_price_4)
```

## Predicting house using size and condition

several intercepts, same slopes
