he importance of hypothesis testing and its application in real-world scenarios. Hypothesis testing helps determine if the observed differences in data are meaningful or due to random chance. Here are the key points you covered:

-   **A/B Testing**: You explored how Electronic Arts used A/B testing to compare two versions of a web page to see which one resulted in higher pre-orders for SimCity 5. This method helps in making data-driven decisions by comparing outcomes of different scenarios.

-   **Sample Mean Calculation**: You learned to calculate the sample mean, which is a type of point estimate. For example, you calculated the mean annual compensation of data scientists from a survey dataset.

-   **Bootstrap Distribution**: You generated a bootstrap distribution of sample means by resampling the dataset multiple times. This distribution helps estimate the standard error of the sample statistic.

-   **Z-Scores**: You standardized values using z-scores, which indicate how many standard deviations a sample statistic is from the hypothesized parameter value. For instance, you calculated the z-score for the proportion of late shipments.

Here's an example of calculating a z-score:

```         
# Hypothesize that the proportion is 6%
late_prop_hyp <- 0.06

# Calculate the standard error
std_error <- late_shipments_boot_distn %>% 
  summarize(sd_late_prop = sd(late_prop)) %>% 
  pull(sd_late_prop)

# Find z-score of late_prop_samp
z_score <- (late_prop_samp - late_prop_hyp) / std_error

# See the results
z_score
```

-   **p-values**: These quantify the evidence against the null hypothesis. A small p-value suggests rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, while a large p-value suggests sticking with the null hypothesis.

-   **Significance Level (α)**: This is the cutoff point for deciding whether a p-value is small or large. Common choices are 0.05, 0.10, and 0.01. If the p-value is less than or equal to α, you reject the null hypothesis.

-   **Confidence Intervals**: These provide a range of plausible values for a population parameter. For a significance level of 0.05, a 95% confidence interval is used.

-   **Type I and Type II Errors**: Type I errors (false positives) occur when the null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. Type II errors (false negatives) occur when the null hypothesis is incorrectly accepted.

## t-test

```{r}
# Calculate the numerator of the test statistic
numerator <- (xbar_no - xbar_yes)

# Calculate the denominator of the test statistic
denominator <- sqrt( (s_no ^ 2 / n_no) + (s_yes^ 2 / n_yes))

# Calculate the test statistic
t_stat <- numerator / denominator

# See the result
t_stat
```
